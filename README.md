# Resources
[CSS Icons](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_icons.asp)

Used instructions on CSS Icons to place icons for social media.

[Sticky Plugin](http://stickyjs.com/)

This plugin is applied to the title and menu of each page so that when the user scrolls up, the banana icon leaves the page but the "Bluth's Frozen Banana Stand," social media icons, and menu bar stay at the top of the page.

[SlimMenu Plugin](http://adnantopal.github.io/slimmenu/)

This plugin creates a responsive menu bar that is a drop down at the mobile scale and returns to a classic menu on desktop versions.

[Mouseover/Mouseout](https://api.jquery.com/mouseout/)

I used this reference to help with my custom jQuery code. When you mouse over the menu, it turns red instead of blue. When you mouse out, it turns yellow.

[onclick event](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp)

I used this as a reference to add my custom Javascript code. On the home page, if you click the line that says "FROZEN BANANA STAND," a new line will appear below it that says "There's always money in the banana stand."


# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
I had a hard time with this project because a lot of it was focused on content generation and
I think I would have had more time to focus on the coding if I didn't have to spend so much time generating copy.
